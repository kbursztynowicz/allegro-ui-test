This basic GUI-automation framework utilises mainly Java8, TestNG, AssertJ, Maven and remote webdriver manager.

Framework structure is divided into three main parts: objects, actions and tests. I was considering addition of another layer
 in order to be consistent with given-when-then methodology (test shall consist of three steps), however in case of such a
 small framework with little number of tests, it would be unnecessary complication of code.

objects.AlegroPageLocators contain selectors as By objects, that are used for further WebElements localization. I did not decide
 to use WebElement objects as selectors in order to avoid encountering StaleElementReferenceException; sometimes driver initializes
 elements in the beginning of a test and if they change dynamically, driver still refers to their older version.

actions package consists of two classes with test actions; an abstract one contains more framework-common methods,
 such as WebDriver and WebDriverWait initialization etc. AllegroPageAction class contains just test specific methods.

tests package has defined testNG test methods with proper annotations.

Name of the searched item and min price can be defined in the daraProvider method in ConfigurationUITests.class
Main page URL can be defined in the testNGRunner.xml file as a parameter.

In order to run the test right-click on the testNGRunner.xml, and select 'Run' from the context menu.
